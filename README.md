# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Introduction

Advent of Code is an annual coding event that offers a series of programming challenges released daily in December. Each puzzle is crafted to test various programming skills and problem-solving techniques.

## Structure

The repository is organized by years. Each year has its own folder, and within each year's folder, the solutions are categorized by day. For example:

```bash
.
├── 2018
│   ├── 01
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   ├── part1.js
│   │   └── part2.js
│   └── ...
├── 2022
│   ├── 01
│   │   ├── input.txt
│   │   ├── part1.py
│   │   └── part2.py
│   └── ...
└── ...
```
